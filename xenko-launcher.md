>**Note:** If you select the **Close the launcher after starting Xenko** check box, the launcher closes after starting Xenko Studio. If you prefer keeping the launcher open, you can clear the **Close the launcher after starting Xenko** check box.

## Switch or update versions

Xenko launcher can manage different versions of the Xenko SDK. When the Xenko installation is over, click the required version button and then click the Start button. Xenko Studio is launched and you are ready to create your first game!

>**Note:** While updating an existing version, you can choose either a major or a minor version to install. However, once that version is installed, you cannot revert to a bug fix version.

## Visual Studio plugin

After you download your first Xenko SDK, the launcher prompts to install the Visual Studio plugin. Installing this plugin is not mandatory. However, we highly recommend you to install it. Thanks to this plugin, you can edit your shaders directly from Visual Studio.

This plugin provides:

* syntax highlighting
* live-code-analysis with validation
* error-checking
* navigation (jump to definition)

If you manually remove the Visual Studio plugin, you can always install it again with the **Reinstall** button.
