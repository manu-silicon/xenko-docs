# Xenko Studio

A central place to start developing your game with Xenko, the Xenko Studio is helping to fully manage your assets:

- You can import your assets, modify their parameters and see changes in real-time in the preview window.
- You can organize your assets by folders, attach tags and get notifications from modified assets on the disk.
- You can also build a game executable and run it directly from it.

It makes it easy to work in a team with the same assets management experience.

For game developers, the editor is also tightly integrated with your Visual Studio projects enabling to seamlessly sync and switch back-and-forth.
