# Light Streaks

Similar to the [bloom effect](bloom.md), the light streak effect uses the result of the [bright filter](bright-filter.md) to make the bright areas bleed along some direction.

It creates star-pattern beams from the light point.

| Is Anamorphic             | When enabled, it simulates the behavior of anamorphic lenses, which are widely used in big Hollywood productions.                                                  |

|                           | *This exact effect was achieved by using 2 light streaks with a phase of 0, enabling anamorphic mode and slightly distorting horizontally the bright pass result.* |
