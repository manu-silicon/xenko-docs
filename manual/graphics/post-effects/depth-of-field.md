# Depth of Field

Depth of field simulates the behavior of a real camera lens focusing an object. 

By default, the rendering of a game engine produces a very sharp image, which can look a bit too artificial. 

In movies it is common to have the camera focus a specific object of the scene, leaving the background blurred and making very-close objects appear blurry and out-of-focus as well.

The "depth of field effect" is designed to produce such images.

Internally, the effect is achieved by creating several versions of the original image, with different intensity of blur and interpolate between them.

The more layers are used, the better the quality is, but at some performance cost.

| ---------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Size       | Size of the bokeh. It is a expressed as a factor of the image width so it is resolution-independent.                                                                   |

| DOF Areas  | Areas of the depth of field. There are 3 main zones defined by their distance from the camera:                                                                         |

| Auto Focus | When enabled, the DOF Areas are automatically updated so that the camera focuses on the object at the center of the screen.                                            |
