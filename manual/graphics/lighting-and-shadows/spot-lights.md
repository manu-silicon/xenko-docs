# Overview

A spot light is a light producing a cone light positioned in space oriented to a specific direction.

Once selected, the gizmo of the spot light displays its main direction, range and the outer cone:

|                     | *Note Currently, the light support an RGB color but will provide also temperature colors.*                                                                            |
| Range               | The range distance in meters. Above the range distance, the light doesn't affect models                                                                               |
| Angle Inner         | The inner angle of the spot cone where the light intensity influence is at one                                                                                        |

| Shadows             | All shadows properties are detailed below                                                                                                                             |
| Filter              | Filtering allows to produce **soft shadows** instead of **hard shadows**. Currently, the implemented technique is PCF (Percentage Closer Filtering)                   |
|                     |                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                     | *Note: Other techniques will be added*                                                                                                                                |
| Size                | The size of the shadow map texture. Values are **extra large**, **large**, **medium**, **small** and **extra small**.                                                 |
|                     | See [shadow map atlas size calculation](shadows-optimizations.md) for details.                                                                                        |
|                     |                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                     |  For a spot light, this value is by default **medium**, as a spot light has usually a medium visual impact.                                                           |
| Bias Parameters     | These parameters are used to avoid some artifacts of the shadow map technique                                                                                         |
| Depth Bias          | The amount of depth to add to the sampling depth to avoid the phenomenon of shadow acne.                                                                              |
| Normal Offset Scale | A factor multiplied by the depth bias toward the normal                                                                                                               |
| Intensity           | The intensity of this light. The color is basically multiplied by this value before sending the color to the shader                                                   |
|                     |                                                                                                                                                                       |
|                     | *Note: Currently, this value has no units but this will change in the future.*                                                                                        |
| Culling Mask        | Defines which entity groups are affected by this light. By default, all groups are affected.                                                                          |
