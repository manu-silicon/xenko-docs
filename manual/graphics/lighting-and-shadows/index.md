# Lighting and Shadows

Lights and Shadows are essential components to increase reality of your scene.

The following lights are supported:

- [Directional Lights](directional-lights.md)
- [Spot Lights](spot-lights.md)
- [Point Lights](point-lights.md)
- [Skybox Lights](skybox-lights.md)
- [Ambient Lights](ambient-lights.md)

Currently, only entities with a 3D model are affected by lights.

> **Warning**
> 
> The 1.1.x-beta version supports currently only forward rendering but we will add forward++ rendering in a next update.
