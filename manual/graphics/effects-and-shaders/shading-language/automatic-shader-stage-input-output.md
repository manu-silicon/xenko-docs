# Automatic Shader Stage Input/Output

# Current state of shaders

When you write a HLSL shader, you have to precisely define your vertex attributes and carefully pass them across the stage of your final shader.

Here is an example of a shader that simply use the color from the vertex.

**Code:** Simple HLSL shader

```cs
struct VS_IN
{
	float4 pos : POSITION;
	float4 col : COLOR;
};

struct PS_IN
{
	float4 pos : SV_POSITION;
	float4 col : COLOR;
};

PS_IN VS( VS_IN input )
{
	PS_IN output = (PS_IN)0;

	output.pos = input.pos;
	output.col = input.col;

	return output;
}

float4 PS( PS_IN input ) : SV_Target
{
	return input.col;
}

technique10 Render
{
	pass P0
	{
		SetGeometryShader( 0 );
		SetVertexShader( CompileShader( vs_4_0, VS() ) );
		SetPixelShader( CompileShader( ps_4_0, PS() ) );
	}
}
```


Imagine that you want to add a normal to you model and modify the resulting color according to it. You have to modify the code that computes the color and adjust the intermediate structures to pass the attribute from the vertex to the pixel shader. You also have to be careful of the semantics you use.

**Code:** Modified HLSL shader

```cs
struct VS_IN
{
	float4 pos : POSITION;
	float4 col : COLOR;
	float3 normal : NORMAL;
};

struct PS_IN
{
	float4 pos : SV_POSITION;
	float4 col : COLOR;
	float3 normal : TEXCOORD0;
};

PS_IN VS( VS_IN input )
{
	PS_IN output = (PS_IN)0;

	output.pos = input.pos;
	output.col = input.col;
	output.normal = input.normal;

	return output;
}

float4 PS( PS_IN input ) : SV_Target
{
	return input.col * max(input.normal.z, 0.0);
}

technique10 Render
{
	pass P0
	{
		SetGeometryShader( 0 );
		SetVertexShader( CompileShader( vs_4_0, VS() ) );
		SetPixelShader( CompileShader( ps_4_0, PS() ) );
	}
}
```


This example is quite simple but in a real project situation, the number of shaders is way higher and a single change might mean rewriting tons of shader, structures etc.

Schematically, adding a new attribute requires to update all the stages and intermediate structures from the vertex input to the last stage you want to use the attribute.

# XKSL

XKSL offers a convenient way to pass parameters across the different stages of your shader. The streams variables are:

- variables
- defined like any class member, with the stream keyword.
- invoked with the streams prefix. Forgetting it will result in a compilation error. When the stream is ambiguous (same name), you should provide the class name in front of the variable. streams.<my_class>.<my_variable>

Streams regroup the concept of attribute, varying and output in a single concept.

- an attribute is a streams that is read in a vertex shader before being written.
- an output is a stream that is assigned before being read.
- a varying is a stream that is present across the stage of your shader.

Think of streams as a global object that you can access everywhere without having to put it as a parameter of your functions.

You are not forced to create a semantic for these variables. The compiler will create them automatically. However, keep in mind that **the variables sharing the same semantic will be merged in the final shader**. So be careful when using a semantic. This behavior can be useful when you want to use a stream variable locally without inheriting from the class where it was declared.

Once you have declared a stream, you can access it at any stage of your shader. The shader compiler will take care of everything. The variable just have to be visible from the calling code (meaning in the inheritance hierarchy) like any other variable.

**Code:** Stream definition and use

```cs
class BaseShader
{
	stream float3 myVar;
 
	float3 Compute()
	{
		return streams.myVar;
	}
};
```


**Code:** Stream specification

```cs
class StreamShader
{
	stream float3 myVar;
};

class ShaderA : BaseShader, StreamShader
{
	float3 Test()
	{
		return streams.BaseShader.myVar + streams.StreamShader.myVar;
	}
}
```


# Example of XKSL shader

Let's look at the same HLSL shader as the first example but in XKSL.

**Code:** Same shader in XKSL

```cs
class MyShader : ShaderBase
{
	stream float4 pos : POSITION;
	stream float4 col : COLOR;

	override void VSMain()
	{
		streams.ShadingPosition = streams.pos;
	}

	override void PSMain()
	{
		streams.ColorTarget = streams.col;
	}
};
```


And now let's change it to add the normal computation.

**Code:** Modified shader in XKSL

```cs
class MyShader : ShaderBase
{
	stream float4 pos : POSITION;
	stream float4 col : COLOR;
	stream float3 normal : NORMAL;

	override void VSMain()
	{
		streams.ShadingPosition = streams.pos;
	}

	override void PSMain()
	{
		streams.ColorTarget = streams.col * max(streams.normal.z, 0.0);
	}
};
```


In XKSL, adding a new attribute is as simple as adding it to the pool of streams and use it where you want!
