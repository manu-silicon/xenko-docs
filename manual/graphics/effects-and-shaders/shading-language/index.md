# Shading Language

# Introduction

Xenko is providing a *superset* of the [HLSL Shading language](http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/bb509561%28v=vs.85%29.aspx) , bringing advanced and higher level language constructions. This language enhances the developer experience while authoring shaders with:

- **Extensibility** to allow shaders to be extended easily using Object-Oriented-Programming concepts like class, inheritance, composition.
- **Modularity** to provide a set modular shaders each focusing on a single rendering technique, more easily manageable
- **Reusability** to maximize code reuse between shaders

Xenko Shading Language is automatically transformed to an existing shading language (HLSL, GLSL, GLSL ES)

# Concepts

This part will introduce XKSL, a shading language extending HLSL. Its core concepts are:

- [class inheritance](classes-mixins-and-inheritance.md)
- [composition](composition.md)
- [templating](template.md)
- [shader stage input/output automatic management](automatic-shader-stage-input-output.md)

# How to use

TODO: List of articles to practical usage in Xenko
