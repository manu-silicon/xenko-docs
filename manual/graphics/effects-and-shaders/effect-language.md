# Create shaders in C&#35;

You can create a shader at runtime with @'SiliconStudio.Xenko.Shaders.ShaderSource' objects. They come in three variations:

- @'SiliconStudio.Xenko.Shaders.ShaderClassSource': corresponding to a unique class
- @'SiliconStudio.Xenko.Shaders.ShaderMixinSource': mix several @'SiliconStudio.Xenko.Shaders.ShaderSource', setting preprocessor values, defining compositions
- @'SiliconStudio.Xenko.Shaders.ShaderArraySource': used for arrays of compositions

This method will produce shaders at runtime. However, many platforms do not support HLSL and do not have the ability to compile shaders at runtime. Furthermore, this approach does not benefit from the reusability of mixins. 

# Xenko Effects (XKFX)

Many shaders are variations or combinations of pre-existing ones. For example, some meshes cast shadows, others receive them, still others need skinning.
To reuse code, it is desirable to select which parts to use through conditions, such as "Skinning required".

This is often solved by "uber shaders": Monolithic shaders, which are configured by a set of preprocessor parameters.

Our goal is to achieve the same kind of control, while keeping extensibility and reusability in mind.
Therefore, the simple code blocks defined by XKSL classes, can be mixed together by a shader mixer. This mixing process can use more complex logic, which is described in Xenko Effect (*.XKFX) files.

## General syntax

A *.XKFX file is a small program used to generate shader permutations. It takes a set of parameters (key and value in a collection) and produce a `ShaderMixinSource` ready to be compiled.

**Code:** Example of XKFX file

```cs
using SiliconStudio.Xenko.Effects.Data;

namespace XenkoEffects
{
	params MyParameters
	{
		bool EnableSpecular = true;
	};
	
	shader BasicEffect
	{
		using params MaterialParameters;
		using params MyParameters;

		mixin ShaderBase;
		mixin TransformationWAndVP;
		mixin NormalVSStream;
		mixin PositionVSStream;
		mixin BRDFDiffuseBase;
		mixin BRDFSpecularBase;
		mixin LightMultiDirectionalShadingPerPixel<2>;
		mixin TransparentShading;
		mixin DiscardTransparent;

		if (MaterialParameters.AlbedoDiffuse != null)
		{
			mixin compose DiffuseColor = ComputeBRDFDiffuseLambert;
			mixin compose albedoDiffuse = MaterialParameters.AlbedoDiffuse;
		}

		if (MaterialParameters.AlbedoSpecular != null)
		{
			mixin compose SpecularColor = ComputeBRDFColorSpecularBlinnPhong;
			mixin compose albedoSpecular = MaterialParameters.AlbedoSpecular;
		}
	};
}
```


## Adding mixins

To add a mixin, simply use `mixin <mixin_name>`.

## Using parameters

The syntax is similar to C#. The following rules are added:

- when you use parameter keys, don't forget to add the using `params <class_name>`. Otherwise, keys will be treated as variables.
- no need to tell the program where to check the values behind the keys. Just use the key.

**Code:** Parameters

```cs
using params MaterialParameters;
 
if (MaterialParameters.AlbedoDiffuse != null)
{
	mixin MaterialParameters.AlbedoDiffuse;
}
```


The parameters behave like any variable. You can read and write their value, compare their values and set template parameters. Since some parameters store mixins, they can be used for composition and inheritance, too.

## Custom parameters

You can create your own set of parameters using a structure definition syntax. Even if they are defined in the XKFX file, don't forget the `using` statement when you want to use them.

**Code:** Custom parameters

```cs
params MyParameters
{
	bool EnableSpecular = true; // true is the default value
}
```


## Compositions

To add a composition, simply assign the composition variable to your mixin. This is done with the following syntax.

**Code:** Compositions

```cs
// albedoSpecular is the name of the composition variable in the mixin
mixin compose albedoSpecular = ComputeColorTexture;
 
or
 
mixin compose albedoSpecular = MaterialParameters.AlbedoSpecular;
```


## Partial shaders

It is also possible to break the code into sub mixins that can be reused elsewhere. This is done through the following syntax.

**Code:** Partial shader

```cs
partial shader MyPartialShader
{
	mixin ComputeColorMultiply;
	mixin compose color1 = ComputeColorStream;
	mixin compose color2 = ComputeColorFixed;
}
 
// to use it
mixin MyPartialShader;
mixin compose myComposition = MyPartialShader;
```


You can now use the `MyPartialShader` mixin like any other mixin in the code.
