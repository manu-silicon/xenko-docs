# Navigate in the scene

This topic shows you how to navigate in a scene of the Xenko Studio.

Xenko provides you some inbuilt navigation keys or mouse click and key combinations that you can use to easily navigate in the scene:

* **F:** To focus on an element. First, you must select the entity that you want to focus.
* **Left-click + Up arrow key:** Move the orbital screen forward.
* **Left-click + Down arrow key:** Move the orbital screen backward.
* **Left-click + Left arrow key:** Move the orbital screen to the left. 
* **Left-click + Right arrow key:** Move the orbital screen to the right.

>**Note:** To move the orbital screen faster, press **Shift** while you use the mouse-click and key combinations mentioned above. For example, you can use left-click + **Shift** + Left arrow key to move the orbital screen faster to the left.

The orbital camera can be viewed from various angles using the **Orthographic Projection** or **Perspective Projection**.
