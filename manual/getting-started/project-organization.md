# Project organization

We have discussed how to [create a project](http://doc.xenko.com/latest/manual/getting-started/howto-create-and-setup-new-game.html) in the Xenko Studio. In this topic, we will discuss how a Xenko project is organized.

A Xenko project is organized into various parts. Each game is contained in a package. A project simply means a game project. In Xenko Studio, the Solution explorer section displays the hierarchy of your game. Assets are the objects used in your game. Finally, resources are images, textures, and entity images used in your game.

Thus, following is the hierarchy of game projects in Xenko:

* [Package](engine/package.md) 
* [Project](engine/project.md)
* [Solution](engine/solution.md)
* [Assets](engine/assets.md)
* [Resources](engine/resources.md)
