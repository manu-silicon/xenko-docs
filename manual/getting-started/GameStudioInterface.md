## Game Studio Interface

We discussed on how to create a new project. The new project created is opened in a Game Studio Interface.

 * Game Studio Interface can be used for:
 * Creating content for a new game.
 * Adding components like assets, graphics, audio, or animations for a game.
 * Setting properties for each component.
 * Building and executing a game.
