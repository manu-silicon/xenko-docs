# HOWTO: Install Xenko

Welcome to Xenko!

Here are a few steps to get you started.

# Download

Head to the [Xenko download page](http://paradox3d.net/download)  and download the latest version.

# Install

Double-click on XenkoSetup.exe to start the installation.

The installer will automatically download the dependencies and install Xenko.

# Launcher

The Xenko launcher can manage the different versions of the Xenko SDK.

It also propose shortcuts to all your recent projects and provides direct links to tutorials, news and help forums.

The list on the left lists all the Xenko SDK versions available on the server. 

Simply click on the **Download** button next to latest Xenko version (grayed).

We also provide a **plugin for Visual Studio integration**. 

After you download your first Xenko SDK, the launcher will propose to install the plugin. 

This plugin is not compulsory, but we highly recommend you to install it. Thanks to this plugin, you can edit your shaders directly from Visual Studio: it provides syntax highlighting, live-code-analysis with validation, error-checking and navigation ("jump to definition"...). 

If you manually remove the plugin from Visual Studio you can always install it again with the **Re-Install** button. 

When the install is over, choose the version to start by clicking on it and then click the **Start** button.

Then the Game Studio will be launched and you will be ready to [create your first game](howto-create-and-setup-new-game.md)!
