>**Note:** Select the **Close the launcher after starting Xenko** check box to close the launcher after the Xenko Studio starts.

## Switch or update versions

Xenko launcher can manage different versions of the Xenko SDK.

There are the following versions of Xenko:

* **Major** – It is a major update to the software.
* **Minor** – It is a small update to the software.
* **Bug fix** – It is any change made to the software, for example, bug fixes and small updates.

Xenko launcher allows you to choose a version because breaking changes happen between two versions and you may not necessarily want to update your game.

>**Note:** While updating an existing version, you can choose between a major (1.x.x) and a minor (1.1.x) version to install. However, you cannot revert to a bug fix version (1.1.1) once installed.

When the Xenko installation is over, click the required version button and then click the Start button. The Xenko Studio is launched.

* Click the release notes button to view the release notes of a Xenko version.
* Click the download and install button to install the required Xenko version. 
* Click the uninstall button to uninstall a Xenko version.

## Visual Studio plugin

After you download your first Xenko SDK, the launcher prompts to install the Visual Studio plugin. Installing this plugin is not mandatory. However, we highly recommend you to install it. Thanks to this plugin, you can edit your shaders directly from Visual Studio.

This plugin provides:

* syntax highlighting
* live-code-analysis with validation
* error-checking
* navigation (jump to definition)

If you manually remove the Visual Studio plugin, you can always install it again with the **Reinstall** button.
