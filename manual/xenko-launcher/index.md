>**Note:** Select the **Close the launcher after starting Xenko** check box to close the launcher after the Xenko Studio starts.

## Version management

With  the Xenko launcher, you can manage different versions of the Xenko SDK.

There are the following types of versions of Xenko:

* **Major**: It is a major update to the software that adds significant changes to the program. In a Major version, the first digit of the version is changed, for example, 1.x.x is changed to 2.x.x.
* **Minor**: It is a small update to the software that adds minor changes to the program. In a Minor version, the second digit of the version is changed, for example, 1.1.x is changed to 1.2.x.
* **Bug fix**: It is a change made to the software to fix bugs or problems found in the software. In a Bug fix version, the third digit of the version is changed, for example, 1.1.1 is changed to 1.1.2.

The launcher allows you to choose the Xenko version because breaking changes may happen between versions and you may not necessarily want to update your game.

>**Note:** While updating an existing version, you can choose between a major (1.x.x) and a minor (1.1.x) version to install. However, the bug fix version updates cannot be reverted.

When the Xenko installation is over, click the required version button and then click the Start button. The Xenko Studio is launched.

* Click the release notes button to view the release notes of a Xenko version.
* Click the download and install button to install the required Xenko version. 
* Click the uninstall button to uninstall a Xenko version.

## Visual Studio plugin

After you download your first Xenko SDK, the launcher prompts to install the Visual Studio plugin. Installing this plugin is not mandatory. However, we highly recommend you to install it. Thanks to this plugin, you can edit your shaders directly from Visual Studio.

This plugin provides:

* syntax highlighting
* live-code-analysis with validation
* error-checking
* navigation (jump to definition)

If you manually remove the Visual Studio plugin, you can always install it again with the **Reinstall** button.
