# File System

The static class @'SiliconStudio.Core.IO.VirtualFileSystem' is the recommended way to access files in a cross-platform manner.

It offers all basic operations such as reading, writing, copying, checking existence and deleting files.

> **Note**
> 
> Path separator is / (Unix/Linux convention).    

# Usage

```cs
// Open a file through VirtualFileSystem
var gamesave1 = VirtualFileSystem.OpenStream("/roaming/gamesave001.dat", VirtualFileMode.Open, VirtualFileAccess.Read);
 
// Alternatively, you can directly access the same file through its file system provider (mount point)
var gamesave2 = VirtualFileSystem.ApplicationRoaming.OpenStream("gamesave001.dat", VirtualFileMode.Open, VirtualFileAccess.Read);
```

# Specific considerations

- On Android, we should offer ability to have roaming and/or local exposed on SDCard if user wants it (so that backup/copy of data is easy).
  
  Or maybe it could be alternative mount point?
