# Resources

Resources are images, textures ([```.dds```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectDraw_Surface) files and entity images used in your game. Resources are stored in the **Resources** folder of a game application.

>**Note:** As a best practice, all data resources should be moved inside the **Resources** folder so as to move your project easily. If resources are outside of the project, moving the project breaks the links and compiler issues can occur.
