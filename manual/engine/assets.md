# Assets

Assets are the objects used in your game, such as data, meshes, textures, materials, and sounds. Most of the assets are generated while importing a source file, for example, while importing an audio file or a 3D model.

Assets can also be created from scratch, such as entities. For each asset, a single file is created, usually with an extension starting by ```.xk```. For example, the texture asset uses the ```.xktex``` extension. You can sort assets into folders and subfolders for easy access. The root path of the assets of a package is stored in the package file.
