# Project

In the Xenko Studio, a project refers to a game project. You can create new games, new packages, and play various types of sample games.

After you create a new project in the Xenko IDE, Xenko creates a Visual Studio application at the same location on your machine. The Visual Studio application includes the **Assets**, **Bin**, and **Resources** folders similar to a .NET application.
